# Seelie-Jump
This game, "Seelie Jump" was created through Python as a final game project for my introduction to programming course.

# ----------------------------------------------CHECK POINT ONE INFORMATION---------------------------------------------
#### OVERALL DESCRIPTION ####
# For players, the game's objective is to reach the end point (located on the right) using a move-able character with
# their keyboard. There will also be enemies that walk back and forth around the map; if the character touches the
# enemy, the player will lose the game and have to restart. (UPDATE: The character also loses if it falls off the map.)
# Once the character reaches the end point, the player wins and a "win" screen will be displayed.
#### REQUIRED FEATURES ####
# 1. User Input: Our game will allow users to use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the main
#    character/player around the map.   UPDATE: up was changed to the space bar, and down is not implemented.
# 2. Start Screen: The start screen will have the name of our game, student IDs, and basic instructions. From there,
#    the game will begin when a key (s) is pressed.
# 3. Game Over: The game will be "lost" when the player touches an enemy. Once they touch the enemy, the game over
#    screen will appear. UPDATE: the player can also lose if the character falls off the screen.
# 4. Small Enough Window: The window size of the game will be 800 x 600.
# 5. Graphics/Images: We will be drawing our own designs for each gamebox character/entity and background.

#### OPTIONAL FEATURES ####
# 1. Restart from Game Over: When the game is "lost", the game over screen will appear. From there, the user may press
#    a key (r) to restart the game in the initial setup.
# 2. Sprite Animation: When the main player moves, they will have animated movements. We also hope to implement sprite
#    animation for the enemies as well.
# 3. Enemies: There will be enemies that will be walking back and forth and if the player touches one, the game will
#    end and the player will need to restart the game from the beginning.
# 4. Scrolling Level: We want the map to be fairly large (larger than the window size). This will be accomplished by
#    moving the camera in our game and having a background image to show that the screen is scrolling.

# CHECKPOINT TWO was removed because it had no comments and was just previous code that we have already updated for the
# final submission.
